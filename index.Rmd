_This dataset was created to be used in my Capstone Project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate_

Data was web scraped from the state websites to combine the GIS information like FIPS, latitude, longitude, and County Codes by both number and Mailing Number.

### GIS Data with FIPS, Lat and Long

[Texas Counties Centroid Map](https://data.texas.gov/widgets/ups3-9e8m?mobile_redirect=true)

### County Codes referring to Mailing Addresses

[Texas Workforce Commission Tax County Codes](https://www.twc.texas.gov/tax-county-codes#countyCodesForEmployersQuarterlyReport)


The tidyverse, rvest, and XML packages were used.


### Beginning the Web Scrape Process

Convert URL to HTML
```{r}
page <- read_html("https://www.twc.texas.gov/tax-county-codes#countyCodesForEmployersQuarterlyReport")
```

Creating the tables as a variable in R
```{r}
tables <- page %>% html_table(fill=TRUE)
```

Preview the data to confirm it was extracted from the website.
```{r}
glimpse(tables)
```

Since the data was separated into 4 tables alphabetically I then separated the tables into their own variables to aggregate them into one data frame.
```{r}
countiesAF <- tables[[1]]
countiesGL <- tables[[2]]
countiesMR <- tables[[3]]
countiesSZ <- tables[[4]]
```

Now we could merge the data to create one data frame
```{r}
countymailingcodes <- rbind(countiesAF, countiesGL, countiesMR, countiesSZ)
```

To confirm that it was put into one data frame we can do a glimpse function to preview the number of rows.
```{r}
glimpse(countymailingcodes)
```

### End Web scrape Process

The following website had the option to simply download a .csv file of displayed data. 

[Texas Counties Centroid Map](https://data.texas.gov/widgets/ups3-9e8m?mobile_redirect=true)

Then we could import the CSV using the read function and set as variable countyGISdata.
```{r}
countyGISdata <- read.csv("Texas_Counties_Centroid_Map.csv")
```

### Joining The Data

A full Join can be performed for the two tables based on County Name since we want all the data in each table to be present. 
```{r}
TexasCountyGISData <- full_join(countymailingcodes, countyGISdata, by=c("County" = "CNTY_NM"))
```

Now export TexasCountyGISData to excel file as .csv  
```{r}
write.table(TexasCountyGISData, file="Texas_County_GIS_Data.csv", row.names=F, sep=",")
```

After viewing the joined table in excel, their were formatting issues with the following county names which resulted in "NA" values after the join above. 

Austin County       -   Austin    |
DeWitt              -   De Witt   |
Houston County      -   Houston   |
Tyler County        -   Tyler     |

*To keep the formatting the same I edited in excel to exclude "County" in the names and left Dewitt as one word.* 

Imported the .csv back to view in Rstudio
```{r}
UpdatedTexasCountyGISData <- read.csv("Texas_Counties_GIS_Data_Updated.csv")
```

View a Tibble of the updated and joined dataset. 
```{r}
head(UpdatedTexasCountyGISData)
```

I want to rearrange the columns and rename them for uniformity in the final exported version.  
```{r}
colnames(UpdatedTexasCountyGISData)
```

Now we can create the final table, rearrange the columns, rename the columns for uniformity in one code chunk.  
```{r}
TexasCountyGISDataFinal <- UpdatedTexasCountyGISData %>%
  
  select(County, Tax.Code, CNTY_NBR, FIPS, X..Lat., Y..Long., County.Centroid.Location, Shape_Leng, Shape_Area) %>%
  
  rename(Code_Mailing=Tax.Code, Code_Number=CNTY_NBR, X_Latitude=X..Lat., Y_Longitude=Y..Long., Centroid_Location=County.Centroid.Location)
```

```{r}
TexasCountyGISDataFinal
```
Now we export to final .CSV file
```{r}
write.table(TexasCountyGISDataFinal, file="Texas_Counties_GIS_Data_Final.csv", row.names=F, sep=",")
```

### Final Notes

I could have just edited the names and rearranged them in excel but I thought it would be more fun to come back into Rstudio and play around with some of the functions to learn a bit more. 

I converted the .csv file to a google spreadsheet to make it accessible via the link below for those that are interested in making a copy into their own drive.
