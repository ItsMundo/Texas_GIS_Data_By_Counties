# Texas_GIS_Data_By_Counties
## A Simple Web Scrape

_This project was created in RStudio using R._

Having completed the 7th course in the Google Data Analytics Certificate Program I started the 8th and final course to start on the Capstone Project/Case Study. 
This file could be my first step in the data gathering aspect of the case study but I thought it would merit its own repository so I can showcase the methods I used in acquiring the data since I am going down the route where I use my own datasets. 


All info is in the following link to the project in the form of an R Markdown File turned into an HTML website.

_I utilized [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to deploy this R Markdown file from RStudio for accessibility._
